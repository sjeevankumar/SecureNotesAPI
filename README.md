Subject: Request for Additional Opportunity to Demonstrate Skills

Dear Hiring Team,

I hope this message finds you well. I recently came across the opportunity at (5 Jan 2024 6:30PM) your esteemed organization and, despite the limited time available, I have invested my efforts to submit a partial implementation of the project.

Due to the time constraints, I acknowledge that the delivered project might not be complete. However, I wanted to showcase my coding abilities and adherence to industry best practices within the given timeframe. I am confident that with more time, I can provide a more comprehensive and polished solution.

I am experienced in Node.js and Express, as demonstrated in my submission. Moreover, I would like to highlight my proficiency in Java and Spring Boot from my prior work experience. I believe that given another opportunity, I can further exhibit my skills and dedication to delivering high-quality solutions.

I appreciate your understanding of the time limitations and kindly request another chance to prove my capabilities. I am eager to discuss my approach, learnings, and potential improvements during an interview or any subsequent evaluations.

Thank you for considering my request. I am looking forward to the possibility of contributing to your team.

Best Regards,
Jeevan Kumar
